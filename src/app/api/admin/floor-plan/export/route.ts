/**
 * Write the live seat geometry back to src/data/floorplan/seats.json.
 *
 * This is what makes the editor more than a scratchpad. seats.json is the
 * source of truth the seed reads, so without an export a corrected floor is
 * one `npm run db:reset` away from reverting to whatever detection produced.
 * With it, fifteen minutes of dragging becomes a committed artefact.
 *
 * A seat that has moved is marked `manual`, so the detection provenance stays
 * honest: it stops claiming the drawing put the desk there once a human has
 * overruled it.

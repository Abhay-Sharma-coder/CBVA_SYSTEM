/**
 * Level of detail for the floor plan, shared by the 2D and 3D renderings.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Phase 4 recorded it and did not build it: at whole-floor
 * zoom the seven status fills are illegible, and Phase 7's colour-accurate
 * texture makes that worse rather than optional. Nobody picks a desk from
 * sixty metres up. The question at that framing is "how full is the floor and
 * which wing is busy", which is a DENSITY question, not a per-seat one.
 *
 * So past the threshold the plan answers the density question, and inside it
 * the plan answers the per-seat one. It does not try to make per-seat status
 * readable at a zoom where it never can be — the Phase 4 attempt to do that by
 * enlarging the glyph plate smeared the atlas across every desk, because the
 * atlas cell holds one CENTRED glyph and stretching the plate stretches the
 * glyph with it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It is not a second colour vocabulary. A bay chip is
 * drawn from `--seat-booked-fill` against `--seat-available-fill`, the same two
 * values a seat uses, and it carries its own count as the non-colour
 * differentiator. There is exactly one colour map in this product.

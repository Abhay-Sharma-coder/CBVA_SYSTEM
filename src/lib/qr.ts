 * Per-desk QR codes.
 *
 * The strongest recommendation we have made to this client. A door swipe proves
 * somebody entered the floor; it does not prove they used C3-04. Occupancy
 * analytics built on door swipes cannot tell a full floor from a half-full one
 * where everybody walked past the same reader — and it makes the whole product
 * depend on an access-control vendor whose export format we have never seen.
 *
 * A sticker on the desk removes both problems. The QR encodes an ordinary URL;
 * the identity comes from the session, not from the code, so the sticker is not
 * a secret and a photograph of it grants nothing.

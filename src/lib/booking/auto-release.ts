/**
 * Auto-release: the rule the brief is actually about.
 *
 * A booking nobody checks into within `settings.auto_release_minutes` of its
 * start is a desk being held by somebody who is not there. Releasing it is what
 * turns booking data into occupancy data — without it every no-show inflates
 * utilisation and the partners right-size the floor against a number that
 * counts empty chairs as full ones.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THIS FILE IS THE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT.
 *
 * Each transition is ONE conditional `UPDATE … RETURNING`. Everything the brief
 * asks for falls out of that:
 *
 * - **Idempotent** (edge case 2): the second run's predicate no longer matches,
 *   because the first run moved the row out of `confirmed`. Zero rows updated,
 *   zero notifications.
 * - **Safe to run concurrently**: under READ COMMITTED a second runner blocks
 *   on the row the first has locked, then re-evaluates the predicate against
 *   the committed row and finds it no longer qualifies. No advisory lock, no
 *   job table, no leader election.
 * - **Only this run notifies**: `RETURNING` hands back exactly the rows this
 *   statement transitioned, so the notification loop cannot pick up somebody
 *   else's work.
 * - **Never touches the wrong row** (edge case 4): `checked_in` and every
 *   cancelled state are outside every predicate, by name.
 *
 * And it reads `clock.now()`, never the system clock — which is what makes the
 * demo honest. Advancing the demo clock two hours makes the REAL job run the
 * REAL rule against REAL rows and really release the desk.
 *
 * THE BLAST RADIUS IS NOW BOUNDED — ASSUMPTIONS A22, closed in Phase 5.
 *
 * These were unbounded UPDATEs, which is correct when the clock is right and
 * catastrophic when it is not: a test driving the job from 2099 settled 577
 * real bookings in one run during Phase 3 and emptied the demo floor. Nothing
 * complained; it was noticed because the floor plan looked wrong afterwards.
 *
 * Three bounds now, and one of them is a deliberate design choice rather than
 * an obvious one:
 *
 * - **A batch cap that applies NOTHING when it trips**, not a partial batch. A
 *   plain `LIMIT 250` would have settled those 577 rows over three cron ticks
 *   instead of one — the same catastrophe, three minutes slower, and now
 *   indistinguishable from normal operation in the audit log. A bound that only
 *   slows a runaway down is not a bound.
 * - **A horizon**, so a backlog older than a few days is left for a human
 *   rather than settled silently. It is counted, not ignored.
 * - **A dry run**, so the cron's effect is inspectable before it is trusted.
 *
 * The cause is bounded too, upstream: `demo_offset_seconds` is CHECKed to ±30
 * days in the database and clamped at POST /api/clock. No downstream bound can
 * do that, because from a bad clock's point of view the job is behaving
 * perfectly.

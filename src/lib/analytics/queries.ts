 * This has to average PER DAY and cannot reuse occupancyBy("weekday"), which
 * would be quietly and badly wrong. `count(distinct seat_id)` grouped over an
 * eight-week period saturates: nearly every desk gets used on some Monday
 * eventually, so every weekday returns ~93 and the chart renders flat — hiding
 * the exact finding it exists to show.
 *
 * So: aggregate per (date, slot) first, then average those daily figures across
 * the weekday. `observedDays` is returned as well, because a period containing
 * nine Mondays and eight Fridays would otherwise let a sum favour Monday for no
 * reason but the calendar.

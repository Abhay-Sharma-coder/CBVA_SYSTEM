/**
 * The shapes the analytics reads return, and the labels that go with them.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM queries.ts ON PURPOSE, and this is a bundle boundary rather
 * than tidiness. `queries.ts` imports `@/lib/db`, which imports `pg`, which
 * needs `fs` — so a client component importing ANYTHING from it, even a single
 * label constant, drags the Postgres driver into the browser bundle and the
 * build fails with "Can't resolve 'fs'".
 *
 * It is the same trap ADR-031 documents for `three`, one layer down, and it
 * fails the same way: not with a wrong number, but with a build error or a
 * bundle four times bigger than it should be. Types alone would survive
 * erasure; a runtime value like WEEKDAY_LABELS does not, which is exactly how
 * this was found.
 *
 * Nothing in this file may import anything with a runtime dependency.

 * seats.json is the source of truth for seat position: the seed reads it, and
 * the editor at /admin/floor-plan writes back to it. The database mirrors it so

 * building's interior centroid (`tools/cad/build_floorplan.py` `build_zones`),
 * so every hull includes the core and adjacent zone rectangles overlap it by
 * roughly 32 plan units once `zoneBounds`'s own padding is added. That is
 * enough to push a zone-focus fit below `LOD_2D_EXIT_BAY` / `LOD_3D_EXIT_BAY`,
 * landing a zone selection in bay/chip detail instead of per-seat — the
 * opposite of what picking a zone is for.
 *
 * This is the tightest fit a zone can have — it is built from the desks
 * themselves — and needs no change to the committed geometry: it fixes the
 * zone-view LOD problem at every viewport down to about 490px wide purely by
 * dropping the core overlap. Below that width the wing's own physical extent
 * (not the hull) is what does not fit; see the LOD-forcing note beside the
 * callers of this function.

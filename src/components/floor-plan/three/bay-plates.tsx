/**
 * Bay-level occupancy in 3D, as floor decals — the far half of the LOD switch.
 *
 * WHY. At whole-floor framing a desk is a few pixels across and its status
 * glyph is sub-pixel, so the seven-status vocabulary is not merely hard to read
 * there, it is unreadable in principle. Phase 4 tried to fix that by enlarging
 * the glyph plate and smeared the atlas across all 141 desks, because the cell
 * holds one CENTRED glyph and a bigger plate stretches it. The answer is not a
 * bigger mark, it is a different question: how full is each bay.
 *
 * ONE DRAW CALL, by the same construction RoomLabels uses (ADR-045) and for the
 * same reason: every plate is a quad in world space, all of them merged into a
 * single BufferGeometry whose UVs already point at that bay's row of one strip
 * atlas. Thirteen bays or thirty, it stays one mesh and one texture.
 *
 * So this layer SUBTRACTS from the draw-call budget rather than adding to it —
 * it replaces up to six per-status glyph instance meshes with one.
 *
 * A decal, not a billboard, for RoomLabels' first reason: the top-down preset
 * is the acceptance test for this view, and a decal lies in the plan while a
 * billboard turns to face the camera and breaks it.
 *
 * NOT INTERACTIVE, like everything here that is not a desk.

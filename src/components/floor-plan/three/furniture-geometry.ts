 * A desk and a chair, built from primitives.
 *
 * Deliberately not a GLTF. This is a wayfinding tool at a 53-degree tilt, not a
 * product visualisation: at the scale a desk actually occupies on screen, a
 * modelled office chair and six boxes are indistinguishable, and the boxes cost
 * nothing to load, nothing to license and nothing to keep in the repo.
 *
 * Each is merged into ONE BufferGeometry so drei's <Instances> can draw all 141
 * in a single call. Both are built at the origin with their base on y=0 and
 * their occupant facing -Z, so a seat's `rotationDeg` is the only thing that
 * has to be right per instance.

/**
 * The status surface: a panel covering most of the desktop, in the status's
 * LINE colour, carrying its glyph.
 *
 * This started as a 0.34 m tile and it was the wrong idea twice over. The seven
 * FILL colours are tuned for a 2D chip that sits inside a coloured border next
 * to a glyph — as the body colour of a solid object seen from twenty metres up,
 * `available` paper and `booked` navy-tint are both simply pale, and the desks
 * read as a scattering of white blocks with no status at all. Enlarging the
 * tile to 0.62 m did not help either: at whole-floor zoom a desk is eight
 * pixels across, and a mark inside it is one.
 *
 * So the desktop IS the swatch. The panel takes the line colour, which is the
 * strong half of every token pair, and the glyph rides on it. It is the same
 * fill-plus-border-plus-glyph vocabulary the 2D plan uses, sized for a surface
 * being looked at rather than a chip being read.
 *
 * `available` has no glyph in the token table, and gets no panel at all — a
 * bare desktop, which is the same statement the 2D plan's plain outline makes,
 * and it keeps the free desks the lightest thing on the floor.

/**
 * The status mark: a small square lying on the desktop, carrying the glyph.
 *
 * It was briefly grown to cover the whole desktop, on the theory that a bigger
 * mark reads better from further away. It does not — the atlas cell holds one
 * centred glyph, so stretching the plate stretches the glyph with it, and every
 * desk on the floor turned into an indistinct dark blob. The desktop itself is
 * the status swatch; this is the non-colour cue sitting on it, and it is sized
 * to be a mark rather than a surface.

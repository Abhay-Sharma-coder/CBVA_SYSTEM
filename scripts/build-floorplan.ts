 * then validates every JSON file against the same zod schemas the app parses
 * them with, so a bad build fails here rather than at runtime.
 *
 * The outputs are committed. Nobody needs to run this to work on the app.

/**
 * ASSUMPTIONS A24, and the reason this step exists at all.
 *
 * The extractor cannot place eleven of the 141 desks from the drawing -- those
 * bays yield fewer chair blocks than the schedule calls for -- so it
 * interpolates them by dividing up the bay. That spacing is not the drawing's,
 * and it put fifteen pairs of desks closer together than a desk is wide, the
 * worst 6 cm apart. Phase 5 fixed it by running
 * `scripts/fix-interpolated-anchors.mjs --write` BY HAND, once, over the
 * committed file.
 *
 * Which quietly broke the build. From that moment `npm run build:floorplan`
 * regenerated seats.json from the PDF and reverted all eleven, and nothing
 * said so: the phase gate compared two consecutive BUILDS to each other and
 * they always agreed. It was proving the build deterministic, never that it
 * produced the file in the repository. That is a false green, which is worse
 * than a red -- it is a check that reports success for a property nobody is
 * testing. Verified by reproducing it: a Phase 6 build reverted exactly those
 * eleven anchors and took the floor from 0 colliding pairs back to 15.
 *
 * So the de-collide is part of the pipeline now rather than a thing somebody
 * remembered to do. It is deterministic -- each interpolated desk is re-placed
 * along its own bay's axis at the drawing's measured 23.02-unit (1,624 mm)
 * pitch, then relaxed a step at a time until it clears every other desk -- and
 * it refuses to write if any collision remains, so it is its own safety net.
 *
 * It must run on FRESH extractor output and exactly once. Run over its own
 * result, the relaxation pass would be measuring against already-moved
 * neighbours rather than the ones the extractor produced.

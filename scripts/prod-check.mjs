/**
 * What "presentable" means for the deployed demo, as a pure function.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM prod.mjs. Phase 6's deploy promoted code that
 * selected a column production did not have. Every meeting-room query failed,
 * and recovering from it ran the seed, which deletes bookings and room_bookings
 * wholesale before regenerating them (ADR-008) -- so failing between the delete
 * and the insert left production with ZERO bookings and ONE meeting room.
 *
 * `prod:check` was run afterwards and said "looks presentable" against THREE
 * bookings. It selected the count, printed it, and asserted nothing about it.
 * A guard that greenlights the exact damage it exists to catch is worse than no
 * guard, because it also supplies a reason not to look.
 *
 * Pulling the judgement out of the transport is what makes it testable. The
 * damaged shapes that actually occurred are in tests/unit/prod-check.test.ts and
 * run on every `npm test`, so this cannot quietly regress the way it quietly
 * failed to exist.
 *
 * FAILURES exit non-zero; WARNINGS do not. The distinction is whether a partner
 * opening the demo would see something wrong.

/**
 * The seed builds eight weeks of history plus five forward working days, which
 * comes out around 5,800 bookings. The floor is deliberately well below that:
 * it is not a precise expectation, it is the line under which the demo has
 * visibly lost its history. Three bookings is the number that got past the old
 * check; two thousand is comfortably above any legitimate variation in the
 * seed and comfortably below anything that looks populated.

   * THE DISTRIBUTION GUARD (Phase 8 / B2) — the third guard this project has
   * added only after the failure it exists to catch.
   *
   * Phase 7 pointed the e2e suite at production by accident and it
   * auto-released 65 of 95 bookable desks on the demo date. Every count above
   * stayed healthy throughout — 141/141/93, ~5,800 bookings, 5 rooms — and
   * `evaluateProduction` reported "looks presentable" because nothing here
   * asked what SHAPE the bookings were in, only how many there were. A count
   * guard sees data go missing; it is blind to the same data being present
   * but wrong.
   *
   * WHY "TODAY" AND NOT A RUNNING RATIO. `auto_released` is not a count that
   * accumulates the way "12% of bookings are no-shows" suggests — it is a
   * SNAPSHOT of no-shows caught while their slot was still running, and once
   * assigned it never changes (auto-release.ts only ever transitions OUT of
   * `confirmed`, never into or out of `auto_released` again). Once a day is
   * fully over, its no-shows settle to `completed_no_show` instead — that is
   * the OTHER terminal status, and it is the one that accumulates with the
   * calendar. So `auto_released` is concentrated on the current day (and
   * briefly on the one just before it), not spread evenly across a trailing
   * window — a ratio measured over 21 days would dilute today's damage with
   * three weeks of `completed_no_show` history that was never in danger.
   *
   * Measured, not assumed: against the actual seeded database, a single
   * day's `auto_released` count sits at 19–27% of bookable capacity in the
   * worst slot observed. 40% clears that with real margin and is nowhere
   * near the 68% (65 of 95) the incident actually produced.

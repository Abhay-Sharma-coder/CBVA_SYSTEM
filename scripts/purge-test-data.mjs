/**
 * Remove test fixtures the suites left behind.
 *
 * `createPhase3Fixtures` builds a private floor (number 900), zone, seats, users
 * and a room so the integration tests can run safely against the seeded demo
 * database. `destroyPhase3Fixtures` removes them — but only if the run reaches
 * `afterAll`. A killed run, a crashed process or a timed-out hook leaves them,
 * and the debris is not inert:
 *
 *   · orphan seats make `expect(seats).toHaveLength(141)` fail
 *   · orphan users make the seed report 145 people
 *   · orphan series keep the materialiser queueing failure notifications, which
 *     then break the edge-case test that counts dispatch results
 *
 * Every one of those has cost real debugging time on this phase. Run this after
 * an interrupted suite.

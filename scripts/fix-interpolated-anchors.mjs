/**
 * ASSUMPTIONS A24 — re-place the eleven interpolated desks at the drawing's own
 * workstation pitch.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. Phase 2 located 130 of the 141 desks from the drawing's own
 * geometry by detecting the repeated chair block. The other eleven were
 * INTERPOLATED, and the interpolator spaced them by dividing up the bay rather
 * than by stepping at the pitch the drawing actually uses. The result is fifteen
 * pairs sitting closer than the 1.30 m a desk is wide, the worst being C7-04 at
 * 6 cm from PA-15 — effectively the same desk drawn twice.
 *
 * On a 90-metre floor at fit-to-floor zoom two anchors 6 cm apart are the same
 * pixel, so this was invisible on the 2D plan for two phases. Two solid desks
 * 6 cm apart in the 3D view are not.
 *
 * THE FIX, and its limits. Each interpolated desk is re-placed by continuing its
 * bay's own axis from the last DETECTED desk in that bay, stepping at the
 * measured pitch — 23.02 plan units, which meta.json's scale note records as
 * 1624 mm at 1:200. It then relaxes: while any desk is still inside another's
 * footprint, the interpolated one is nudged one further step along the axis.
 *
 * They stay flagged `interpolated`, NOT `manual`. This makes them no longer
 * overlap; it does not make them right. The drawing genuinely does not say where
 * these eleven chairs are, and marking them as a human correction would claim a
 * confidence nobody has. A24 stays open, and fifteen minutes in
 * /admin/floor-plan with somebody who knows the floor still closes it properly.

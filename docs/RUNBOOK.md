# Runbook — the deployed demo

> ## ✅ RESOLVED (2026-09-06) — production is seeded and Phase 6 is live
>
> Production is healthy: **141 users, 141 seats, 93 bookable, 5,804 bookings,
> 5 meeting rooms, clock offset 0.** `npm run prod:check` is clean and the live
> URL serves the Phase 6 build.
>
> **What actually happened, because the first diagnosis was wrong.** An earlier
> note here said `bay_code` was "not in `src/lib/db/schema.ts` and not in any
> migration". It was in both — `schema.ts:274` and `drizzle/0004_room_bay_code.sql`,
> journalled and committed in `6049e63`. The real fault was narrower and is the
> whole reason this runbook exists:
>
> **migration 0004 had only ever been applied to the LOCAL database.**
> `npm run db:migrate` reads `.env.local`. Production never received the column,
> the deploy promoted code that selects it, and every meeting-room query failed
> with `42703`. The fix was one command — `npm run prod:migrate` — not a code
> change.
>
> The seed then deletes `bookings` and `room_bookings` wholesale before
> regenerating them (ADR-008), so failing between the two emptied both. It also
> deletes meeting rooms no longer in `MEETING_ROOMS`, so production was left with
> **one** room, not six. `npm run prod:seed` restored all of it.
>
> **The local database was never damaged.** It reports 5 meeting rooms because
> five is correct after Phase 6, and it has held 5,804 bookings throughout;
> `npm run seed` completes cleanly and is idempotent across two consecutive runs.
>
> **The lesson worth keeping:** a schema change has to reach the production
> database *before* the code that reads it is promoted. Nothing in this project
> sequences those, which is why `prod:migrate` exists and why it comes before
> `deploy` in the release steps below.
>
> One gap left open deliberately: `prod:check` warns on seat/user counts, clock
> offset and queued mail, but **not on a near-empty `bookings` table** — the
> exact damage that occurred. It reported "looks presentable" against 3 bookings.
> Worth a threshold.

Operating the live demo: where it is, where its credentials are, how to seed it,
and what breaks it. **If you are a new session picking this repo up, read this
before touching any database.**

## The two databases, and why confusing them matters

| | Neon project | Env file | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Production** (the demo) | `ep-bold-dream-b36xsna6` (c-4) | `.env.production.local` | Vercel only |
| **Local** (dev + tests) | `ep-empty-hall-az0hv77p` (c-3) | `.env.local` | `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `npm run e2e` |

Both are Neon Postgres 18 in `ap-southeast-1`, and they hold the same shape of
data — which is exactly why running the wrong command against the wrong one is
easy and silent.

**They are separate on purpose.** `npm test` and `npm run e2e` mutate demo data
deliberately: the walkthrough books, cancels and auto-releases real rows, and
`runAutoRelease` is global by design. Sharing one database would mean a local
test run changing what a partner is looking at on the live URL, mid-demo.

### Where the credentials are

**`.env.production.local`**, in the repo root. It is **not committed** —
`.gitignore` covers `.env*`, and it must stay that way. The file itself explains
what each variable is for.

If it is missing, recover it with `npx vercel env pull` (the Vercel project is
`cbva-workspace`, account `qlink149`), or read the values from the Vercel
dashboard under Project → Settings → Environment Variables.

**`CRON_SECRET` is deliberately not in that file.** It lives only in the Vercel
project. Nothing local needs it — `/api/cron/jobs` is called by Vercel Cron.

---

## Operating production

Every database script defaults to `.env.local`. Production is a **different
verb**, never a different variable:

```bash
npm run prod:check                        # read-only. Run this first, always.
npm run prod:migrate -- --yes-production  # apply drizzle/*.sql
npm run prod:seed    -- --yes-production  # rebuild the 8 weeks of demo history
npm run prod:jobs    -- --yes-production  # run auto-release / series / mail once
npm run deploy                            # vercel deploy --prod
```

`scripts/prod.mjs` prints the host it is about to touch **before doing
anything**, refuses without `--yes-production`, and refuses outright if the
resolved host looks like the local database. There is deliberately no `reset`
verb — dropping the production schema should not be one word away.

> **Why a wrapper rather than `export DATABASE_URL=…` in the docs.** Aiming a
> script at production by hand means exporting two connection strings correctly,
> in the right shell, every time. Getting it wrong rebuilds the wrong database's
> history and you find out when somebody opens the demo.

### `prod:check` before and after anything

```
target : ep-bold-dream-b36xsna6.c-4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
db     : neondb
mode   : APP_MODE=demo

 users 141 · seats 141 · bookable 93 · bookings 5805 · meeting_rooms 5
 live_releases 12 · series 1 · clock_offset 0 · queued_mail 0
migrations: 5/5 applied

looks presentable.
```

**It exits non-zero on a FAILURE, so it can gate a deploy.** Until Phase 7 it
always exited 0 and asserted almost nothing — it selected the bookings count,
printed it, and reported **"looks presentable" against three bookings**, which
is exactly the damage the Phase 6 deploy caused. A guard that greenlights the
failure it exists to catch is worse than no guard, because it also supplies a
reason not to look.

**Failures — these block, and each one has happened:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **A migration on disk that production has not applied** | The cause of the Phase 6 outage, and the only one that is a live failure rather than a presentation problem. `db:migrate` reads `.env.local`, so it migrates the LOCAL database; the deploy then promotes code selecting a column production was never given. |
| Fewer than 2,000 bookings | The demo history is gone. What an interrupted seed leaves behind. |
| Meeting rooms ≠ 5 | The seed deletes rooms before inserting; a partial run left production with one. |
| Seats or users ≠ 141 | Test debris. |
| No bookable seats at all | Nobody could book anything. |

**Warnings — these do not block:** a non-zero clock offset, a backlog of queued
mail, no live releases or recurring series, and production being *ahead* of this
checkout (you are probably on an older branch).

The judgement lives in `scripts/prod-check.mjs` as a pure function, and
`tests/unit/prod-check.test.ts` feeds it the three damaged shapes the incident
actually produced. It was also **demonstrated failing end to end** against a
throwaway database seeded and then damaged three ways — see PHASE-7-HANDOFF.
`node scripts/prod.mjs check --scratch-url=…` is how that is re-run; it is
accepted by `check` only, which performs no writes.

## The two routine jobs

### Re-seed after a demo, or after e2e ran against the live URL

The e2e suite books, cancels and auto-releases real rows. If it was pointed at
the deployment (`PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://cbva-workspace.vercel.app npm run
e2e`), the live floor is left mid-walkthrough.

```bash
npm run prod:seed -- --yes-production
npm run prod:check
```

The seed is **idempotent and deterministic** — every id is a UUID v5 of its
natural key and all randomness comes from a fixed seed, so two runs produce
identical data. It deletes and rebuilds `bookings` and `room_bookings` wholesale
and upserts everything else.

**It refuses to run when `APP_MODE=production`.** `.env.production.local` sets
`APP_MODE=demo`, which is also what the deployment runs, so this works — and it
is the guard that stops anybody seeding a genuinely live installation.

### Reset the demo clock

`settings.demo_offset_seconds` is **one global row**. Advancing the clock during
a demo moves it for everybody, including anybody else with the URL open, and it
stays advanced until somebody resets it.

Easiest: the **Reset** button next to the clock readout in the app header. From
a shell, `prod:check` will tell you if it is non-zero.

---

## Deploying a change

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build   # all four
npm run prod:check                        # FIRST: does production match this code?
npm run prod:migrate -- --yes-production  # only if prod:check says the schema is behind
npm run deploy
npm run prod:check                        # again: did the deploy leave it healthy?
```

**`prod:check` goes FIRST now, not only last.** It reports whether production
has every migration this checkout carries, which is the question the Phase 6
deploy did not ask and could not answer. Deploying while it says `<- BEHIND`
is the outage, reproduced.

**Migrations are not wired into the build** — there is no `vercel-build` or
`postinstall` hook, so a schema change is a deliberate step. That is the safe
default; automate it only alongside a backup policy.

Migrations are hand-written and hand-registered in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`.
`drizzle-kit generate` must not be allowed to clobber `0001`, `0002` or `0003` —
they contain partial indexes and CHECK constraints drizzle cannot express.

---

## `next start` READS `.env.production.local`. Run `npm run start:local` instead.

**This is the sharpest trap in the repository and it bit during Phase 7.**

`next start` sets `NODE_ENV=production`, and Next.js loads `.env.production.local`
at **higher priority than `.env.local`** in production. So the obvious way to
exercise a production build locally:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081 npm run e2e     # ← DO NOT
```

silently points the entire suite at the **deployed database**. `PHASE-6-HANDOFF`
recommends exactly this, because `next dev` restarts itself on Next's memory
threshold mid-suite and looks like flakiness. It is right about the flakiness and
wrong about the target.

It fails in the worst way available: **everything passes.** The app is fine and
the data is a copy of the same seed, so there is no error and no failing test.
The only consequence is that the e2e suite — which books, cancels, advances the
demo clock and drives a real auto-release, deliberately — does all of that to the
database a partner is looking at.

What it actually did: production came back with **65 of 95 bookable desks
auto-released** on the demo's default date and five extra bookings. `prod:seed`
repaired it in one command, and `prod:check` had said *"looks presentable"*
throughout — correctly, because the counts were all fine. The damage was to the
DISTRIBUTION of bookings, which no count threshold can see.

**So:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:local -- -p 8093                 # forces .env.local, refuses anything else
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8093 npm run e2e
```

`scripts/start-local.mjs` resolves the connection strings from `.env.local`
itself and puts them in the child's environment, where they outrank every `.env`
file Next reads — then refuses outright if the resolved host is not the local
one. `npm start` is left alone: it is what Vercel runs, and it should keep
reading production config.

---

## Things that will bite you

**`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must be set on Vercel.** It defaults to
`http://127.0.0.1:8081`, so stickers printed from `/admin/qr` without it encode
localhost and are useless on a desk. Currently
`https://cbva-workspace.vercel.app`.

**`CRON_SECRET` must be set on Vercel.** When it is unset and `APP_MODE` is not
exactly `production`, `/api/cron/jobs` is world-callable — and the demo
`AuthProvider` resolves an unknown visitor to a seeded admin, so "is the caller
an admin?" is true for anybody on the internet. ADR-041. Verify with:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST https://cbva-workspace.vercel.app/api/cron/jobs
# must be 401
```

**Interrupted test runs leave debris in the LOCAL database.** The integration
fixtures clean up in `afterAll`, which a killed run never reaches. Orphan seats
break the "141 desks" assertion, orphan users make the seed report 145 people,
and an orphan recurring series keeps queueing failure mail that breaks an
unrelated test. Fix:

```bash
npm run db:purge-test-data
```

**Anything that writes to `settings` in a test must snapshot and restore it.**
It is a singleton shared by every test and by the running app. One test widened
the booking window to 4000 working days and never put it back; the date strip
then offered hundreds of days and the recurring-booking materialiser dutifully
tried to book every one of them. Every test in that file timed out and none of
them looked like the cause.

**The first request after a quiet period is slow.** Cold serverless start plus a
first connection to Neon in Singapore is ~7 seconds to first byte. Warm, every
route is under 200 ms. Open a tab a minute before a demo.

---

## Recovering from a mess

**The live floor looks wrong or empty.** Almost always an advanced clock, or a
suite that ran against it.

```bash
npm run prod:check                        # look at clock_offset first
npm run prod:seed -- --yes-production
```

**The schema is behind the code.** `prod:check` will error on a missing column.

```bash
npm run prod:migrate -- --yes-production
```

**You need a completely fresh production database.** There is no `prod:reset` on
purpose. Do it deliberately: create a new Neon project, put its two connection
strings in `.env.production.local` and in the Vercel project, then
`prod:migrate` and `prod:seed`. The direct (unpooled) host is the pooled host
with `-pooler` removed; prove it with `prod:check` before migrating, because
PgBouncer's transaction pooling breaks DDL sequencing (ADR-001).

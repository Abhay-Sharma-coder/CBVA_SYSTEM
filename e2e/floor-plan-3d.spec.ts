 *
 * Two things had to be got right here, and both were got wrong first.
 *
 * CLICKING IS THE WRONG PROBE. The first version clicked around the canvas
 * until a booking dialog appeared. Every click re-rendered a software-rasterised
 * scene, so a sweep cost minutes and timed out. Hovering is far cheaper — the
 * raycast is CPU work, independent of how slowly the frame draws — and
 * `data-focused-seat` reports the answer, so this asks the real raycaster
 * exactly one question per probe and leaves the pointer sitting on the hit.
 *
 * AND IT HAS TO ZOOM IN FIRST. At whole-floor framing the building is 90 metres
 * across in about 1,200 pixels, so a 1.3 m desk is roughly eight pixels wide and
 * a grid fine enough to land on one is enormous. Filtering to a wing first makes
 * a desk about 30 pixels across, which a sane grid hits — and it exercises the
 * shared zone filter on the way past.
 *
 * Deliberately not a projection computed inside the test: reimplementing the
 * camera transform here would test the test rather than the scene.

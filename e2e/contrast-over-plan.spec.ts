/**
 * Contrast for everything drawn OVER the architect's drawing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every contrast figure in this product was taken against a
 * near-white plate: ink-subtle at 4.90:1, the opaque status tints, the
 * person-picker fix. Phase 7 put the architect's drawing behind the plan in the
 * drawing's OWN colours — red workstation hatch across most of the C and D
 * wings, orange rapid rails, green credenzas — which moves the background under
 * every seat chip, bay chip and room label.
 *
 * AXE CANNOT JUDGE ANY OF IT. When it cannot reduce a background to a single
 * computed colour it returns `color-contrast` as INCOMPLETE, which is not a
 * pass. Running axe alone after this change and reporting zero violations would
 * be a false green of exactly the Phase 6 kind: a check reporting success for a
 * property nobody is testing. `accessibility.spec.ts` now prints that
 * incomplete count per surface — 44 on the floor plan — so the gap is visible
 * rather than assumed away.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SPEC DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
 *
 * Everything here is judged from COMPUTED COLOURS or from CONSTRUCTION. There
 * is no pixel sampling, and that is a considered retreat rather than a
 * shortcut. Sampling "the worst background pixel behind the text" cannot be
 * made reliable: every glyph edge blends ink into whatever is behind it, so an
 * anti-aliased pixel is always an intermediate tone and always scores about
 * 2:1 — for ANY text on ANY background, black-on-white included. Excluding
 * pixels near the foreground helps and does not settle it, because the blend is
 * a gradient and wherever the cutoff is placed some pixel sits just past it.
 * Three successive thresholds gave 2.06, then 3.75, then would have given
 * something else again. At that point the number is a property of the threshold
 * and not of the design, and tuning it until it passes is the exact behaviour
 * these gates exist to prevent.
 *
 * The seat chips against the drawing ARE measured against real pixels — in
 * `tests/unit/texture-contrast.test.ts`, against the baked texture itself, at
 * the plan coordinate of all 141 seats. No anti-aliasing, no neighbouring chip
 * to contaminate the sample, no browser. It is a better instrument for the same
 * question, and it compares against the Phase 6 texture, so a regression is
 * distinguishable from a figure that was already there.

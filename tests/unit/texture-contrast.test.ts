/**
 * Can a seat chip be seen against the architect's drawing?
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A UNIT TEST AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. Phase 7 bakes the drawing in
 * its own colours -- red workstation hatch across most of C and D, orange rapid
 * rails, green credenzas -- so the background under every seat moved. The
 * obvious way to check is to screenshot a chip and sample around it. That does
 * not work, and the reason is worth writing down: in a bench run the nearest
 * non-chip pixels are OTHER CHIPS. Desks sit about 40px apart at working zoom
 * and a chip is 28px wide, so a ring around one chip reads a neighbour's navy
 * border as "the background" and reports 1:1. Widening the ring only reaches
 * further into the next chip.
 *
 * So it is measured here instead: directly against the baked texture, at the
 * plan coordinate of every one of the 141 seats, with no neighbours in the way
 * and no browser involved. This is both more precise and cheaper -- and it
 * covers all 141 rather than whichever one happened to be on screen.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED. WCAG 1.4.11 asks for 3:1 on "the visual information
 * required to identify user interface components". For a seat that is the 1px
 * OUTLINE, not the fill: an `available` desk is deliberately paper-coloured,
 * the same ground the drawing sits on, and its navy border is what makes it a
 * desk rather than a smudge. It is also what the greyscale and colour-vision
 * guarantee on /styleguide rests on.
